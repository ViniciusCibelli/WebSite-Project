# WebSite Project
 Welcome to my College Website Project Repository!

This repository houses a website project that I developed during my college years to practice and refine my HTML and CSS skills. While the project remains incomplete, it serves as a testament to my dedication to learning web development.

Within this repository, you'll find the codebase for my website project, showcasing my efforts to create a functional and visually appealing website. Although it may lack some features or polish, every line of code represents an opportunity for growth and improvement.

Feel free to explore the project, examine the HTML and CSS files, and perhaps even provide feedback or suggestions for enhancement. Whether you're a fellow student looking for inspiration or an experienced developer offering guidance, your input is invaluable to me.

Thank you for visiting my repository! If you have any questions or insights to share, please don't hesitate to reach out.
